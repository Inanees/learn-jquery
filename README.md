Journey to learn JQuery

## The Plan
I joined a meetup for a hackathon in March 2019. Teams were challenged to create any kind of web application that should consists of primarily JavaScript and JQuery. This would motivate us to deepen our knowledge on JQuery.

The challenge was to finish our projects in less than 3 hours. The other team proposed a quiz-based web app that heavily used JavaScript.

My team and I developed a business website for a mock cafe that showcased its wide range of cake, desserts and coffee with their prices.
Since there was a time limit, this repository contains rough codes.
