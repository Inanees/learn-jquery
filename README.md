Journey to learn JQuery

## The Plan
I joined a meetup for a hackathon in March 2019. Teams were challenged to create any kind of web application that should consists of primarily JavaScript and jQuery. This would motivate us to deepen our knowledge on jQuery. I created a [repository](https://github.com/sisterhood-full-stack-dev/full-stack-journey/blob/master/README.md) for us to gather our resources and references.

The challenge was to finish our projects in less than 3 hours. The other team proposed a quiz-based web app that heavily used JavaScript.

My team and I developed a business website for a mock cafe that showcased its wide range of cake, desserts and coffee with their prices.
Since there was a time limit, this repository contains rough codes.


## Resources and Methods
- [Comparison](https://www.educba.com/javascript-vs-jquery/) between JavaScript and jQuery. I've been introduced to JavaScript before, so this is a good start to know their differences.
- Simple [jQuery Examples](https://www.taniarascia.com/simple-jquery-examples-with-code-and-demos/) with Code and Demos. We made sure to try the majority of the codes to incorporate into the final product. Each of my team members took a different part. We tried to include features like dropdown, tab, accordion, and change on scroll.
- Created a personal account on [CodePen](https://codepen.io). Made it easier to share codes with my team members.
- Some cafe refences like [example1](https://shop.cloudcatcher.asia/) and [example2](http://www.caffecrema.my/#about) were used to base our model website with.
- How To Use jQuery In [Html](https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-use-jquery-in-html/). This introduced on how to use it via locally or over the cloud.
- I learnt that jQuery can be used when performing some [action](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_syntax.asp) on the HTML element. It gets easier after understanding the jQuery syntax.
